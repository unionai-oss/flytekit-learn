# Basic Example

This project contains source code for building and deploying a serverless application
that you can run locally and serve via FastAPI.

It includes the following files and folders:

- `app.py`: The UnionML app code for digits classification.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile to package up the UnionML app for AWS Lambda serving.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies of the app.
- `data`: Sample data used for invoking prediction endpoints.

The code in `app.py` implements a hand-written digits model, but you can adapt the code to
fit your use case.
