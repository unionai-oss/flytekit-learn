# Basic AWS Lambda Example

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders:

- `app.py`: The UnionML app code for digits classification.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile to package up the UnionML app for remote backend deployment.
- `Dockerfile.awslambda`: Dockerfile to package up the UnionML prediction endpoint for AWS Lambda serving.
- `events`: Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- `data`: Sample data used for invoking prediction endpoints.
- `tests`: Unit tests for the application code.
- `template.yaml`: A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.
