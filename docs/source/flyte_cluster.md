# Deploying to Flyte

UnionML integrates tightly with [Flyte](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/), which is
a data- and machine-learning-aware orchestration platform that leverages cloud services like
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) to easily scale and
maintain data processing machine learning workloads.

In this guide, we'll:

1. Spin up a demo Flyte cluster, which is a standalone, minimal Flyte cluster that you can
   create on your individual laptop or workstation.
2. Configure digit classification UnionML app to use the Flyte sandbox as the compute
   backend for our training and prediction workload.


````{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: important

- Install [`flytectl`](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytectl/en/latest/index.html#installation),
  the command-line interface for Flyte.
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and make sure you have the Docker daemon running.

## Deploy App Workflows

A UnionML app is composed of a {class}`~unionml.dataset.Dataset`, {class}`~unionml.model.Model`, and
serving app component (e.g. `fastapi.FastAPI`). Under the hood, a `Model` object exposes
`*_workflow` methods that return [`flytekit.workflow`](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytekit/en/latest/generated/flytekit.workflow.html#flytekit.workflow) objects, which are essentially
execution graphs that perform multiple steps of computation.

To make these computations scalable, reproducible, and auditable, we can serialize
our workflows and register them to a Flyte cluster, in this case a local Flyte demo cluster.

### Initializing a Digits Classification App

Going back to our digit classification app, let's assume that we've
{ref}`initialized our app <initialize>` using the `unionml init my_app` command
and have an `app.py` script with our digits classification model.

````{dropdown} See app.py

   ```{literalinclude} ../../unionml/templates/basic/{{cookiecutter.app_name}}/app.py
   ```

````

### Start a Local Flyte Demo Cluster

To start a Flyte demo cluster, run the following in your app directory:

```{prompt} bash
---
prompts: $
---

flytectl demo start --source .
```

```{note}
The `--source .` flag will initialize the Flyte demo cluster in a docker container with your app files
mounted inside. This is so that your app's workflows can be serialized and registered directly in the
Flyte sandbox.
```

We should now be able to go to `http://localhost:30080/console` on our browser to see the Flyte UI.


### The App Dockerfile

UnionML relies on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to package up all of your app's
source code and dependencies. The basic app template comes with a `Dockerfile`, which
we can use to do this:

````{dropdown} See Dockerfile

   ```{literalinclude} ../../unionml/templates/basic/{{cookiecutter.app_name}}/Dockerfile
   ---
   language: docker
   ---
   ```

````

### Configuring the Remote Backend

All you need to do to get your UnionML app ready for deployment is to configure it with:

1. The Docker registry and image name that you want to use to package your app
2. The Flyte project and domain you want to use hosting your app's microservices.

In the `app.py` script, you can see the following code that does just this:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/integration/sklearn_app/remote_config.py
---
lines: 5-10
---
```

```{important}
We've set the `config_file` argument to
`Path.home() / ".flyte" / "config.yaml"`, which was created automatically when
we invoked `flytectl demo start`.

Under the hood, UnionML will handle the Docker build process locally, bypassing the
need to push your app image to a remote registry.
```

### Managing your Own Flyte Cluster

In this guide we're using the Flyte demo cluster that you can spin up on your local machine.
However, if you want to access to the full power of Flyte, e.g. scaling to larger compute
clusters and gpu accelerators for more data- and compute-heavy models, you can follow the
[Flyte Deployment Guides](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/index.html).

```{important}
To point your UnionML app to your own Flyte cluster, specify a `config.yaml` file in the `config_file`
argument that is properly configured to access that Flyte cluster. In this case, you'll also need to
specify a Docker registry that you have push access to via the `model.remote(registry="...")` keyword
argument.

To learn more about cluster configuration, see [here](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/cluster_config/index.html#deployment-cluster-config).
```

## UnionML CLI

The UnionML python package ships with the UnionML cli, which we use to deploy the model and
invoke the training/prediction microservices that are automatically compiled by the `Dataset` and
`Model` objects.

### `unionml deploy`

To deploy, run:

```{prompt} bash
---
prompts: $
---

unionml deploy app:model
```

```{note}
The first argument of `unionml deploy` should be a `:`-separated string whose first section
is the module name containing the UnionML app and second section is the variable
name pointing to the `unionml.Model` object.
```

```{warning}
The Flyte demo cluster may take a few seconds to create the resources required to run your
workflows after running the `unionml deploy` command. If the commands below fail, retry
them after a few seconds.
```

Now that your app workflows are deployed, you can run training and prediction jobs using
the Flyte sandbox cluster:

### `unionml train`

<a href="cli_reference.html#unionml-train">CLI reference</a>

Train a model given some hyperparameters:

```{prompt} bash
---
prompts: $
---

unionml train app:model -i '{"hyperparameters": {"C": 1.0, "max_iter": 1000}}'
```

### `unionml predict`

<a href="cli_reference.html#unionml-predict">CLI reference</a>

Generate predictions with json data:

```{prompt} bash
---
prompts: $
---

unionml predict app:model -f data/sample_features.json
```

Where `data/sample_features.json` is a json file containing feature data that's compatible with the model.

```{note}
Currently, only json files that can be converted to a pandas DataFrame is supported.
```

````{important}

   You can also generate predictions by fetching data from the `dataset.reader` function. However,
   this assumes that you've correctly factored your reader to get data from some arbitrary source.
   For example, you can implement your reader function to get data from an s3_path:

   ```{code-block} python
   @dataset.reader
   def reader(s3_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
       return pandas.read_csv(s3_path)
   ```

   Then, you can generate predictions with the `--inputs` option:

   ```{prompt} bash
   ---
   prompts: $
   ---

   unionml predict app:model --inputs '{"s3_path": "s3://my-bucket/path/to/data.csv"}'
   ```

````


## Programmatic API

UnionML also provides a programmatic API to deploy your app and kick off training and prediction jobs
that run on the Flyte cluster. We simply import the UnionML `Model` object into another python module:

### {meth}`~unionml.model.Model.remote_deploy`

```{code-block} python
from app import model

model.remote_deploy()
```

### {meth}`~unionml.model.Model.remote_train`

```{code-block} python
from unionml.model import ModelArtifact

from app import model

model_artifact: ModelArtifact = model.remote_train(
    hyperparameters={"C": 1.0, "max_iter": 1000},
)
```

The `model_artifact` output `NamedTuple` contains three attributes:
- `model_object`: The actual trained model object, in this case an sklearn `BaseEstimator`.
- `hyperparameters`: The hyperparameters used to train the model.
- `metrics`: The metrics associated with the training and test set of the dataset used during training.

```{note}
By default, invoking `remote_train` is a blocking operation, i.e. the python process will wait until
the Flyte backend completes training.
```

### {meth}`~unionml.model.Model.remote_predict`

```{code-block} python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

from app import model

features = load_digits(as_frame=True).frame.sample(5, random_state=42)
predictions = model.remote_predict(features=features)
```

```{note}
The `features` kwarg should be the same type as the output type of the `dataset.reader`
function. In this case, that would be a `pandas.DataFrame`.
```

````{important}

   Similar to the point about about generating predictions using the `@dataset.reader` function,
   you can pass in the reader keyword arguments to the `model.remote_predict` method, assuming
   your reader function looks like:

   ```{code-block} python
   @dataset.reader
   def reader(s3_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
       return pandas.read_csv(s3_path)
   ```

   You can generate predictions like so:

   ```{prompt} bash
   ---
   prompts: $
   ---

   predictions = model.remote_predict(s3_path="s3://my-bucket/path/to/data.csv")
   ```

````

## Next

Now that you've deployed your UnionML app to a Flyte cluster to scale your training jobs
and do batch prediction, let's see how we can serve these predictions in production
in an online setting with {ref}`FastAPI <serving_fastapi>`.
