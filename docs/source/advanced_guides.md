The guides in this section go beyond the basic use cases of training models and generating predictions from them:

- {ref}`Scheduling Jobs <scheduling>`: schedule training and prediction jobs on a Flyte cluster to run on a
  specified cadence.
- {ref}`Component Callbacks <component_callbacks>`: define callbacks at the app component level, like post-prediction callbacks.
